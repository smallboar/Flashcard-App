# Flashcard-App
Simple Flashcard app (Focused on Client-Server API functionality, not UI)

Setup:
`cd` into the `/server` and `/client` directory separately and run `npm install` on each.

Afterwards, run `npm run start` on both `client` and `server`, and the project will open up in http://localhost:8080/
